# D3D
Practicing 3D Graphics Programming in C++ and using the Direct3D (or DirectX) Graphics Framework.

## To Note
- This is not really a system, but I've tried my best not to just slap code in. I've tried to make it as efficient as I can.
- There are 2 major goals to this:
	1. To eventually write a graphics rendering system (sort of, but not the same as, Blender) or even a game engine.
	2. To learn how graphics rendering works under the hood (think of it like unboxing the black boxes that are DirectX, OpenGL or Vulkan).

PS: After building, copy the assimp-vc140-mt.dll file into the directory with the executable (will probably be x64/Debug or x64/Release).
